This repository contains the scripts for reproducing the results presented in

Costa AC, Vergassola M (2023) "Fluctuating landscapes and heavy tails in animal behavior". https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01111

The data can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10030151 and some of the data results from calculations performed in Costa AC, Ahamed T, Jordan D, Stephens GJ (2023) "A Markovian dynamics for C. elegans behavior across scales" https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12883 (see github repository https://github.com/AntonioCCosta/markov_worm)

Our calculations were performed using Python 3.7.3 and the following packages:

- numpy 1.18.3
- scipy 1.7.3
- scikit-learn 0.22
- msmtools 1.2.4
- umap 0.5.3
